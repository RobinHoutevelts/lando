# Security

If you have discovered a security issue with Lando, please contact the Lando Security Team directly at
[security@devwithlando.io](mailto:security@devwithlando.io). We manage security issues separately in a private repository until the issue has been resolved.
Even if you're not sure if it's a security problem, please contact the security team before filing an issue, blogging, or
tweeting about it.
